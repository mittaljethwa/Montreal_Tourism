						<h3>#1 Mount Royal Park, “The Mountain”</h3>

							Majestic multifunctional city park; walk, cross-country ski, or bike on Olmsted Road to a panoramic view of the cityscape; walking in Catholic or Protestant graveyards just outside the park offers a different angle on Montreal history. The “tam-tams”—a drumming/dancing bacchanal on the mountain’s east side—attract thousands every warm Sunday. Tip: “At Summit Circle on the Westmount side of the Mountain, there’s a less-populated lookout and a bird sanctuary that’s raucous with life in the middle of summer.”—Bill Brownstein, city columnist, the Gazette.

							Île Sainte-H&eacute;lène (named after the wife of Samuel de Champlain) and the artificial island of Notre-Dame were the site of Expo '67. They are now known as Parc Jean Drapeau and have many family-minded attractions. A remnant of the 1967 world fair, the Biosphere is now a museum dedicated to ecological issues. The building is designed in the shape of a sphere and is the largest such structure in the world. Other tourist attractions on the islands include the rides and games of La Ronde Amusement Park, the historic 1820 British arsenal at the Stewart Museum, Bassin Olympique (where the Olympic rowing events were held), and race course Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
