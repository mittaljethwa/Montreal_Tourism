				As the only large French-speaking metropolis in North America, Montreal is a cultural junction — and its dizzying array of food, from poutine to fine French cuisine, reflects that. From internationally famous restaurants to low-key neighbourhood haunts, this guide will direct you to the best food and drink Montreal has to offer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eater puts out a bunch of maps detailing the top places and things to eat and drink within a wide range of categories in Montreal. Below, we selected some notable points on our most popular maps to help time-starved eaters prioritize which spots to visit.

							Le St-Urbain put Ahuntsic on the map for many. More than half a decade on, Marc-André Royal and partner Adam Ganten (who is now guiding the menu) have yet to slow down. This restaurant is home to one of the most professional, unflagging crews in the city, and sister bakery and café La Bête à Pain has been a success, too, expanding into Griffintown.

							Michele Forgione and Stefano Faita grabbed the attention of Montreal diners in 2013 with this finely-tuned Little Italy collaborazione. Now the duo has Gema, a fine pizzeria, down the street, and casse-croûte Chez Tousignant around the corner.

							In Montréal Plaza, ex Toqué! chef Charles-Antoine Crête, with partners Sébastien Blanchette (front-of-house manager) and Cheryl Johnson (co-chef), wanted to provide a place where "people feel welcome and good, like at home." Now they're well settled in, the polished, whimsical, and packed Petite-Patrie restaurant feels like a watershed. Mission accomplished, then.

						<p>
							Mile Ex restaurant Manitoba fittingly just feels like Canada — and in a remarkably modern and fresh way that steers well away from tropes of maple syrup or lumberjacks. Chef Simon Mathys (ex-Bistro Accords) heads up a kitchen that deals in hearty meats and game and ample root vegetables; their winter offerings still feel local, but without seasonal affective disorder, and in summer, the restaurant's backyard is one of the top terrasses in town. It's topped off with a neatly-curated natural wine list, too.
